# VaultPilot Obsidian Plugin

This plugin provides a thin frontend for the EvoAgent X backend. It exposes a view inside Obsidian that allows you to send the current note to the backend and display the result.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled plugin files `dist/main.js` and `manifest.json` can then be copied to your Obsidian vault's plugins folder.
