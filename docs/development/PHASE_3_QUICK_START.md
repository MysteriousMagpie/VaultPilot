## 🔧 Development Setup

### Required Dependencies
```json
{
  "chart.js": "^4.4.0",           // Performance visualizations
  "chartjs-adapter-date-fns": "^3.0.0",  // Time-series charts
  "fuse.js": "^7.0.0",            // Fuzzy search capabilities
  "lodash": "^4.17.21",           // Utility functions
  "react": "^18.2.0",             // UI components (if using React)
  "typescript": "^5.0.0"          // Type safety
}
```

### Install Commands
```bash
cd vaultpilot
npm install chart.js chartjs-adapter-date-fns fuse.js lodash
npm install --save-dev @types/lodash
```

---

## 🎯 Key Integration Points

### 1. Transport Manager Integration
```typescript
// Use existing TransportManager for real-time data
import { TransportManager } from '../devpipe/TransportManager';

const dashboard = new TransportDashboard(transportManager);
dashboard.setupRealTimeUpdates(); // WebSocket-based updates
```

### 2. Enhanced Model Selection Integration
```typescript
// Leverage Phase 2 enhanced service
import { EnhancedModelSelectionService } from '../services/EnhancedModelSelectionService';

const service = new EnhancedModelSelectionService(serverUrl, devPipePath, {
  transport: { /* Phase 2 transport config */ }
});

// Get transport status for dashboard
const status = service.getTransportStatus();
```

### 3. Real-Time Event System
```typescript
// Hook into Phase 2 event system
transportManager.on('transport_switched', (event) => {
  dashboard.updateTransportStatus(event);
  recommendationEngine.analyzeSwitch(event);
});

transportManager.on('performance_metrics', (metrics) => {
  dashboard.updatePerformanceCharts(metrics);
  analytics.recordMetrics(metrics);
});
```

---

## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

### Real-Time Data Pipeline
```
Phase 2 TransportManager 
    ↓ (WebSocket events)
LiveUpdateManager 
    ↓ (processed events)
UI Components (Dashboard, Charts)
    ↓ (user interactions)
RecommendationEngine
    ↓ (insights)
User Interface
```

### Analytics Data Flow
```
User Actions → Usage Intelligence → Pattern Analysis → Recommendations
Transport Metrics → Performance Analysis → Optimization Suggestions
Error Events → Error Experience Manager → Self-Healing Actions
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Component Testing Approach
```typescript
// Test with Phase 2 infrastructure
import { createMockTransportManager } from '../__mocks__/TransportManager';

describe('TransportDashboard', () => {
  let mockTransportManager: jest.Mocked<TransportManager>;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockTransportManager = createMockTransportManager();
    // Use actual Phase 2 interfaces for realistic testing
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Validate Phase 3 components work with Phase 2 infrastructure
node test-phase2.js  # Ensure Phase 2 still works
node test-phase3-integration.js  # Test Phase 3 integration
```
