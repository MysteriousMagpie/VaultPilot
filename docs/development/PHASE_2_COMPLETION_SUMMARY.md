## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
VaultPilotPlugin (Enhanced)
├── EnhancedModelSelectionService
│   └── TransportManager
│       ├── HTTPTransport (enhanced with SSE)
│       ├── WebSocketTransport (real-time)
│       ├── FileSystemTransport (local)
│       └── HealthMonitor + CircuitBreaker
├── Original ModelSelectionService (fallback)
└── Advanced Error Handling + Recovery
```

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Interface-based design**: All transports implement `DevPipeTransport`
2. **Circuit breaker pattern**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
3. **Scoring algorithm**: Intelligent transport selection based on multiple criteria
4. **Event-driven architecture**: Real-time status updates and monitoring
5. **Graceful degradation**: Always maintains functionality even with transport failures

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

### Phase 1 Compatibility Maintained
- ✅ **Original ModelSelectionService**: Still fully functional
- ✅ **Existing API**: No breaking changes to public interfaces
- ✅ **Configuration**: All Phase 1 settings continue to work
- ✅ **Fallback behavior**: Enhanced service falls back to Phase 1 if needed
- ✅ **Plugin loading**: Zero impact on existing plugin initialization

### Migration Path
- **Automatic**: Enhanced service can be enabled with a simple setting toggle
- **Gradual**: Can run both Phase 1 and Phase 2 systems simultaneously
- **Safe**: Always falls back to Phase 1 if Phase 2 encounters issues
