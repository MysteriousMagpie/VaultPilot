# Testing Plan My Day with EvoAgentX Integration

## Changes Made

âœ… **Updated `planner.ts`**:
- Removed dependency on `localhost:3000`
- Now uses EvoAgentX API client for task planning
- Converts EvoAgentX TaskPlanningResponse to schedule markdown

âœ… **Updated `main.ts`**:
- Modified `planMyDay()` to pass `this.apiClient` to `fetchSchedule()`
- Updated error handling for EvoAgentX integration

âœ… **Updated Documentation**:
- `PLAN_MY_DAY_README.md` now reflects EvoAgentX integration
- `PLANNER_FEATURE.md` updated with new API contract

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. **EvoAgentX Server Running**: Make sure your EvoAgentX backend is running
2. **VaultPilot Connected**: Check that VaultPilot shows "ðŸŸ¢ Connected" status in settings
3. **API Key Set**: Ensure your EvoAgentX API key is configured in VaultPilot settings

### Test Steps
1. **Open a Daily Note**: Create or open any note in Obsidian
2. **Add Some Content**: Write tasks, goals, or notes you want scheduled
3. **Run Plan My Day**: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + P` and run "Plan My Day"
4. **Check Results**: Look for:
   - Progress notice: "Planning your day with AI..."
   - Success notice: "âœ¨ Smart schedule created with X tasks!"
   - Schedule section added/updated in your note

### Expected Output
The feature should create a schedule table like:

```markdown
## Schedule
| Time | Task |
|------|------|
| 9:00 | Research Planning |
| 10:30 | Deep Work Session |
| 12:00 | Review and Documentation |
| 2:00 | Project Meeting |
```

## Benefits of EvoAgentX Integration

ðŸŽ¯ **Better AI**: Uses your full EvoAgentX AI capabilities instead of simple test server
ðŸ“… **Calendar Aware**: Can integrate with calendar events for smarter scheduling
ðŸ§  **Context Understanding**: Analyzes your note content for more relevant tasks
âš¡ **Unified API**: Uses same backend as all your other VaultPilot features
ðŸ”„ **Consistent Experience**: Same error handling and authentication as other features

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Planning error: Unable to connect to EvoAgentX server"**
- Check that EvoAgentX is running
- Verify backend URL in VaultPilot settings
- Test connection with "Test Connection" button in settings

**Error: "Planning error: EvoAgentX task planning failed"**
- Check EvoAgentX server logs
- Ensure `/api/obsidian/planning/tasks` endpoint is implemented
- Verify API key is valid

**Error: "Invalid schedule data received from API"**
- EvoAgentX returned empty or malformed task plan
- Check EvoAgentX implementation of task planning endpoint

## Migration Complete

The Plan My Day feature now fully uses EvoAgentX integration:
- âœ… Removed dependency on `localhost:3000/planday`
- âœ… Uses EvoAgentX `/api/obsidian/planning/tasks` endpoint  
- âœ… Leverages full AI capabilities for intelligent scheduling
- âœ… Unified with other VaultPilot features

For production use, EvoAgentX integration is the only supported approach!
