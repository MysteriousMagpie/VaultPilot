# VaultPilot WebSocket Connection Issue - Summary

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified
The VaultPilot Obsidian plugin is trying to connect to a WebSocket endpoint that doesn't exist on the backend server.

**Endpoint Requested**: `ws://localhost:8000/api/obsidian/ws/enhanced`  
**Server Response**: `HTTP 403` (endpoint not found)

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ Backend server is running on port 8000
- ✅ Basic health endpoints are working (`/health` returns 200)
- ❌ Enhanced WebSocket endpoint is missing
- ❌ VaultPilot plugin cannot establish real-time connection

## 🎯 Solution Required
The backend team needs to implement the missing WebSocket endpoint:

### Implementation Required:
```python
@app.websocket("/api/obsidian/ws/enhanced")
async def enhanced_websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    # Accept connection
    # Send welcome message with enhanced features
    # Handle real-time communication
```

## 📋 Next Steps

### For Backend Team:
1. Add the WebSocket endpoint `/api/obsidian/ws/enhanced` 
2. Implement enhanced features support
3. Test with the provided test script: `python3 quick_ws_test.py`

### For Frontend Team:
1. ✅ Issue identified and documented
2. ✅ Test script created for validation
3. ⏳ Waiting for backend implementation
4. 🔜 Test integration once endpoint is available

## 🧪 Validation
Once implemented, the test should show:
```
🔌 Testing: ws://localhost:8000/api/obsidian/ws/enhanced
✅ Connection successful!
📨 Received: {"type":"connection","data":{"status":"connected","enhanced":true}}
```
