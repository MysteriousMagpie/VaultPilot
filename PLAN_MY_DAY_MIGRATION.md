# Plan My Day Migration Guide

## ✅ Migration Complete: Removed Test Server

The Plan My Day feature has been successfully migrated from the old test server approach to full EvoAgentX integration.

## What Was Removed

### Files Deleted
- ❌ `test-server.js` - Old Node.js test server
- ❌ `express` dependency from package.json

### Code Changes
- ✅ Updated `planner.ts` to use EvoAgentX API client
- ✅ Modified `main.ts` to pass API client to planner functions
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for EvoAgentX integration
- ✅ Updated all documentation to reflect new integration

## New Workflow

### Before (Old Test Server)
```
User runs "Plan My Day" 
  → Plugin sends note to localhost:3000/planday
  → Simple time-based schedule returned
  → Schedule injected into note
```

### After (EvoAgentX Integration)
```
User runs "Plan My Day"
  → Plugin sends note content to EvoAgentX
  → AI analyzes content and creates smart task plan  
  → Task plan converted to schedule markdown
  → Schedule injected into note with AI insights
```

## Benefits of Migration

### 🎯 **Better AI Capabilities**
- Context-aware planning based on note content
- Intelligent task breakdown and prioritization
- Smart time allocation and scheduling

### 🔗 **Unified Integration**
- Uses same API client as other VaultPilot features
- Consistent authentication and error handling
- Single backend to maintain and configure

### 📅 **Advanced Features**
- Calendar integration (when available)
- Learning from user patterns
- Personalized scheduling recommendations

### 🛠 **Simplified Setup**
- No need to run separate test server
- Uses existing EvoAgentX connection
- Consistent configuration across all features

## For Developers

### API Changes
```typescript
// Old approach
fetchSchedule(noteText: string): Promise<PlannerResponse>

// New approach  
fetchSchedule(noteText: string, apiClient: EvoAgentXClient): Promise<PlannerResponse>
```

### Testing
- Unit tests still work with mock data
- Integration testing uses EvoAgentX endpoints
- No need for separate test server setup

## User Impact

### ✅ What Still Works
- All existing schedule detection and injection logic
- Same command: "Plan My Day" in command palette
- Same schedule section management
- All error handling and user notifications

### ✨ What's Better
- Smarter, AI-powered schedule generation
- Better integration with vault content
- More reliable backend (EvoAgentX vs simple test server)
- Potential for calendar integration and learning

### 🔧 Setup Requirements
- EvoAgentX server must be running and connected
- Same API key and backend URL as other VaultPilot features
- No additional server setup required

## Migration Verification

To verify the migration is working:

1. **Check Connection**: Ensure VaultPilot shows "🟢 Connected" to EvoAgentX
2. **Test Feature**: Run "Plan My Day" on a note with some content
3. **Verify Output**: Look for AI-generated schedule with contextual tasks
4. **Check Logs**: EvoAgentX logs should show `/api/obsidian/planning/tasks` requests

The migration is complete and the feature is now more powerful and reliable! 🚀
