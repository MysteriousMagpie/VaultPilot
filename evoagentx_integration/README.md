- **WebSocket Communication** - Real-time updates and live interactions

## 🔧 Your Implementation Tasks

### 1. API Endpoints (Required)
Implement these endpoints in your EvoAgentX server:

```python
# Health & Status
GET  /status                           # Health check (working)

# Core Chat & AI Features  
POST /api/obsidian/chat               # Main chat functionality (working)
POST /api/obsidian/conversation/history # Chat history retrieval (partial)
DELETE /api/obsidian/conversations/{id} # Delete conversations
POST /api/obsidian/copilot/complete  # Text completion (working)
POST /api/obsidian/workflow          # Workflow execution (working)

# Agent Management
GET  /api/obsidian/agents             # List agents (working)
POST /api/obsidian/agents/create     # Create new agents
POST /api/obsidian/agent/execute     # Execute specific agent

# Advanced Features
POST /api/obsidian/vault/context     # Vault analysis (partial)
POST /api/obsidian/planning/tasks    # Task planning
POST /api/obsidian/intelligence/parse # Intent parsing
POST /api/obsidian/memory/update     # Memory updates
```

### 2. WebSocket Support (Optional but Recommended)
```python
WS /ws/obsidian                       # Real-time communication
```

### 3. Integration Steps
1. **Copy the provided files** to your EvoAgentX project
2. **Install dependencies** (see requirements.txt)
3. **Implement missing endpoints** using the template files
4. **Test integration** with the provided test suite
5. **Configure CORS** for Obsidian plugin communication
