# VaultPilot ↔ EvoAgentX Integration Guide

## ✅ **You're Right - No Local Server Needed!**

You already have an **EvoAgentX server** running. VaultPilot should connect directly to that instead of running a separate server here.

## 🔗 **EvoAgentX Integration Routes**

Your EvoAgentX integration already includes VaultPilot-compatible routes in:
```
evoagentx_integration/obsidian_routes.py
```

This file provides all the necessary endpoints:
- ✅ `/api/obsidian/chat` - Chat interface
- ✅ `/api/obsidian/vault/analyze` - Vault analysis  
- ✅ `/api/obsidian/workflow` - Workflow management
- ✅ `/api/obsidian/copilot/complete` - AI completion
- ✅ WebSocket support for real-time updates

## 🎯 **What You Need To Do**

### 1. **Copy Integration Files to EvoAgentX**
Copy these files to your EvoAgentX server:
```bash
# Copy the integration package
cp -r evoagentx_integration/* /path/to/your/evoagentx/server/
```

### 2. **Add Routes to EvoAgentX FastAPI App**
In your EvoAgentX server, add:
```python
from obsidian_routes import obsidian_router
app.include_router(obsidian_router, prefix="/api/obsidian")
```

### 3. **Configure VaultPilot Plugin**
In your VaultPilot plugin settings, set:
```
Backend URL: http://your-evoagentx-server:port
```

### 4. **Test Connection**
- Start your EvoAgentX server
- In VaultPilot, click "Refresh" 
- Try "Analyze Vault" and "Generate Summary"

## 📋 **EvoAgentX Server Checklist**

Make sure your EvoAgentX server has:
- ✅ FastAPI application running
- ✅ CORS configured for Obsidian
- ✅ VaultPilot routes included (`obsidian_router`)
- ✅ WebSocket support enabled
- ✅ Proper port accessible from Obsidian

## 🚀 **Result**

Once connected properly:
- ✅ **Workflow Management** will work
- ✅ **Analytics Dashboard** will populate
- ✅ **Vault Analysis** will process correctly
- ✅ **Generate Summary** will produce results
- ✅ **Real-time updates** via WebSocket

## 📁 **What's In This Repo**

This VaultPilot repo contains:
- `evoagentx_integration/` - Integration code for your EvoAgentX server
- `vaultpilot/` - The Obsidian plugin itself
- Documentation and examples

**The integration code should be moved to your EvoAgentX server, not run separately here!**

---

**TL;DR**: Copy `evoagentx_integration/` to your EvoAgentX server, include the routes, and configure VaultPilot to connect to EvoAgentX directly. 🎯
